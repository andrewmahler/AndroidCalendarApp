This is an android app I created for my mobile application development class. I created it from scratch. It presents users with a calendar view and allows users to create appointments, move appointments, delete appointments, search for them, and edit them. It uses a SQLite Database to store these appointments.

Files that run app (activity files): found in app/src/main/java/com/example/andrew/calendarapp/
-Calendar.java
-Constants.java
-CreateActivity.java
-DeleteActivity.java
-DeleteActivity2.java
-Edit.java
-EventsData.java
-MainActivity.java
-MoveActivity.java
-MoveActivity2.java
-Search.java
-SearchDisplay.java
-SynonymTask.java
-SynonymTaskForEdit.java
-View_Edit_Activity.java

Layout files: found in app/src/main/res/
*import/copy this entire folder

To Run:
Download the lastest version of android studio and import the activity/layout files to the correct location in the project structure hierarchy (where they were originally found in this cloned project)
